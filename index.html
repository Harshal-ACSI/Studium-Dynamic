        <b>Collaborative Learning</b><br />
        At Studium, we believe that true understanding comes through
        collaboration; students sharing their notes not only helps others but
        also reinforces the knowledge they have themselves. By contributing to
        our platform, you are joining a network of learners who value collective
        intelligence and shared growth in academia.

      <!-- Open Source & Free -->
      <div class="box">
        <b>Open Source & Free</b><br />
        Our dedication extends beyond education to the core values that support
        it; as a platform created by fellow learners, Studium advocates for
        open-source software that is free and accessible to everyone seeking
        academic help or wishing to share their knowledge—the true essence of
        educational freedom and collaboration.
